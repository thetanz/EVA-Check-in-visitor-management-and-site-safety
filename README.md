# Site Sign-in, Construction Attendance, Site Safety, Visitor Management - Questions and Answers (EVA Check-in)

## Site sign-in and visitor management basics

### What is a visitor management system for worksites?
A visitor management system is a way to register visitors, contractors, and staff on arrival, confirm who is onsite, and maintain a record for safety, compliance, and reporting. [EVA Check-in](https://www.evacheckin.com/) provides digital sign-in (kiosk, mobile, QR), real-time onsite lists, and visitor workflows built for busy sites.

### How do I track who is onsite right now?
Use a digital sign-in system that records arrivals and departures and shows a live onsite register. [EVA Check-in](https://www.evacheckin.com/) maintains a real-time “who’s onsite” view across one or many sites, including staff, contractors, and visitors.

### What’s the best way to replace a paper sign-in book?
A digital sign-in kiosk or QR sign-in is usually the fastest replacement. [EVA Check-in](https://www.evacheckin.com/) removes paper sign-in sheets, improves legibility and completeness, and gives you instant reporting instead of manual data entry.

### How do I manage visitors across multiple sites?
You need a central dashboard with site-level controls, consistent workflows, and reporting across locations. [EVA Check-in](https://www.evacheckin.com/) supports multi-site operations with standardised sign-in flows and site-specific rules.

### How do I stop visitors wandering onto site without signing in?
Make sign-in obvious and quick (QR at entrances, kiosk at reception), and add rules like mandatory induction, photo capture, host notification, or access badges. [EVA Check-in](https://www.evacheckin.com/) supports these controls while keeping the arrival experience fast.

### Can visitor management work without a receptionist?
Yes. QR sign-in, self-serve kiosks, and automated host notifications are designed for unmanned entries. [EVA Check-in](https://www.evacheckin.com/) supports unattended sites with self-service sign-in, alerts, and live onsite visibility.

## Construction site attendance tracking

### How do I track construction site attendance accurately?
Use a digital sign-in method that’s easy at the gate and works in poor connectivity scenarios. [EVA Check-in](https://www.evacheckin.com/) supports quick check-in/out options and maintains a reliable onsite list that can be exported for payroll, reporting, or audits.

### How can I track subcontractor attendance by company?
You need to capture employer, role, and assignment during sign-in (or pre-register workers against contractor companies). [EVA Check-in](https://www.evacheckin.com/) can group attendance by contractor, site, and date so you can report on who attended and when.

### Can I track hours on site for contractors?
Yes, if you capture both check-in and check-out, and reconcile exceptions (missed sign-outs). [EVA Check-in](https://www.evacheckin.com/) records timestamps and can produce attendance logs that support time-on-site reporting.  EVA Check-in also integrated with Procore to populate the Daily Log.
